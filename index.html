    <h1> Writing Assignment 1 </h1>

    <p>The software design process is how problems presented to programmers are turned into a blueprint for creating software. Its main focuses are the questions: “what are you solving” and “who is using the product”. This process involves being faced with a problem, understanding and documenting the problem, designing and implementing solutions to the problem and then testing the solution. It is often exemplified by the waterfall process: gather requirements, design, implement, test, maintain. Another approach to this process is the agile method where more time is spent on planning and gathering requirements for small iterations of the solutions to the problem.  </p>
    <p>Software design and planning before the programming process is very important because it gives the developers a better idea of client expectations, resulting in a better user experience. If you begin developing a solution to a problem before clearly designing how the problem will be solved, the program may not accurately solve the problem or produce errors. There must be clearly defined requirements, outlined by the client that define the users, non-standard terms, user terms, priorities and categories of development to create an effective piece of software.  </p>
    <p>One software that I have used that I personally think has effectively prioritized effective software design is the website of Apple, a company that manufactures and sells technological products such as phones and laptops. I believe that their website is designed well because it is easy to navigate and it displays their products in a way that is appealing, with large images, interactive diagrams and colorful design. When opening the homepage of the website, their newest product that customers are more likely to be interested in is displayed in a large image with appealing words like “strong”, light”, and “pro”. They also have a navigation bar at the top of their website with a list of the different services, products and support offered by the company. Included in this section is a search function that allows users to find their desired information. These features provide a feeling of elegance for the brand while keeping the customers engaged. When I used the site, its functions worked effectively and gave me the impression that there was an extensive amount of planning in the design process of this software.  </p>

    <p> 1.	Gathering requirements is the first step in the software development process. It involves communicating with the client to determine the purpose and functionality of the software. The main questions asked during this phase are “what are you solving?” and “who is using the product?”. The requirements are a clear and concise description of the client’s needs. Good requirements define the users, define non-standard terms, define user terms, are categorized, are prioritized and flow logically. They are based on the user stories that are communicated to the developer and written on the requirements document. These requirements are then transformed into a plan for building software. This is a very important stage in the software development process because it clearly defines what problem the software faces and what the client needs the software to do. If the requirements are unknown or unclear, the software will likely not meet the client’s needs or solve its desired problem properly. When the requirements stage is ignored, time and money are wasted because developers might be creating a program that does not do the necessary task. It is the base that the rest of the software development process is built upon.</p> 

    <p> 2.	User stories for apple website:</p> 
    <ol type = "a">
      <li> As a customer, I want to be able to view all available products so that I can choose which one I want to purchase.</li>
      <li> As a warehouse employee, I want to be able to update product inventory, so that website can display product availability.</li>
      <li> As a store employee, I want to be able to add new products to the website when they are released.</li>
      <li> As a customer, I want to be able to purchase products through the website with credit card information so that I can obtain the product. </li>
      <li> As a customer, I want to be able to search for products by typing key words into a search bar so that I can find my desired product more efficiently.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>	Chapter three of the Subject to Change textbook describes the important role of empathy in business models and how to incorporate elements of empathy into a business to provide a greater product or service for the consumer. Empathy involves a flexible and comprehensive understanding of users and the issues they experience.  It is being aware of, sensitive to and vicariously experiencing their feelings and thoughts. Experiencing empathy for the consumer can help the designer create better user stories and deal with the uncertainty of the human behaviour. A business can gain a better grasp of empathy through reviews, surveys, focus groups and interviews with consumers. The text provides three examples of older business models that struggle with elements of empathy, causing overall dissatisfaction for the user. The first business model described sees people solely as a means to profit. This model is the worst for users because it emphasizes revenue over a genuine understanding of need, creating a barrier in developing empathy. The second model likens customers to sheep, considering them gullible, easily fooled through marketing. This model views all users as the same, not being able to think for themselves. This model’s weaknesses lie in ignoring the growing levels of education and connectedness among the public. The third ineffective model is homo economicus, which oversimplifies behaviour to reducing it to decision making for maximum utility. This model ignores the empathy in human decision making and the unpredictability of everyday life. While this model is better in the sense that it moves organizations beyond a focus on messaging toward the features of a product or service, it is too heavily focused on return on. Companies must be attentive to the human factor – a focus on seeing how humans actually use products or services, incorporating real world factors. </p>
