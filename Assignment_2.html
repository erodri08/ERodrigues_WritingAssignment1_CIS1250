1.	Gathering requirements is the first step in the software development process. It involves communicating with the client to determine the purpose and functionality of the software. The main questions asked during this phase are “what are you solving?” and “who is using the product?”. The requirements are a clear and concise description of the client’s needs. Good requirements define the users, define non-standard terms, define user terms, are categorized, are prioritized and flow logically. They are based on the user stories that are communicated to the developer and written on the requirements document. These requirements are then transformed into a plan for building software. This is a very important stage in the software development process because it clearly defines what problem the software faces and what the client needs the software to do. If the requirements are unknown or unclear, the software will likely not meet the client’s needs or solve its desired problem properly. When the requirements stage is ignored, time and money are wasted because developers might be creating a program that does not do the necessary task. It is the base that the rest of the software development process is built upon.
